Question 1: 
"Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. 
To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
- Records
- Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George"

==> Answer:

"Hi George,

Nice to meet you and welcome to Algolia! I'll gladly help you clarify these concepts.

- Records: A record is a single piece of data in your search index. You can think of it like a row in a table. 
           For example, in an e-commerce store, one product would be one record. Records can also have attributes, which describe it. 
           The same product could have attributes related to material and weight, for instance.

- Indexing: This is the process of preparing and storing records in a way that makes them quickly searchable. 
            When you index your data in Algolia, you’re uploading records and configuring them, so that your search engine can find
            more relevant records, faster. For example, you could set the name, category, brand and description of a product as searchable,
            so when a user types something into the searchbar, that information will be used to check for matching records.

- Custom Ranking Metrics: These are attributes you choose to prioritize when Algolia sorts search results. For example, you could let Algolia
                          rank results by sales or popularity, to show high-performing items further up, by ratings, price or any other metric.

Let me know if you have any additional questions. Happy to jump on a call!

All the best,
Lukas"

Question 2: 
"Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. 
Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, Matt"

==> Answer: 

"Hi Matt,

Thank you for the honest feedback. It's always appreciated, even when it’s not positive.

I understand how needing extra clicks for clearing or deleting indexes can slow you down, especially during rapid iteration. 

While the recent dashboard redesign aimed to improve usability for broader use cases, your workflow is absolutely valid. I’ll be sure to share your input 
with our product team. 

In the meantime, you might find our API or the Algolia CLI more efficient for tasks like index clearing during development. I am linking the correct part of
our documentation here for you:

https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/how-to/delete-indices/#delete-indices-with-the-api

Please let me know if you'd like guidance using either option!

All the best,
Lukas"

Question 3: 
"Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

Regards, Leo"

==> Answer:

"Hi Leo,

Nice to meet you! Integrating Algolia doesn’t require heavy development, especially with our libraries and tools.
The high-level process looks like this:

1. Preparing your data: you'll need to format your records in JSON to push it to an index. More info can be found here: 
https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/

2. Pushing your data to an index: you can do so either via API or by uploading a file in the dashboard. If you go for the API
approach, there are different clients available for the programming languages of your choice. If you want to dive deeper into the
different options, this is a good source: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/ 

3. Configure the index: you can set searchable attributes and attributes for filtering and ranking, to make searches most relevant
for your use case.

4. Implementing the search in your front-end: you can use the InstantSearch package (for JavaScript) or a frontend library to connect 
the search to your UI. A guide and live demo of InstantSearch is available in our documentation: 
https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/js/

5. Testing and refining: once everything is set up, you'll likely want to monitor search performance and tweak settings as needed.

If you’re using platforms like Shopify or WordPress, we also offer integrations to make it even easier.

Let me know what tech stack you’re using and I’ll help you get some more tailored information! I am also attaching a link to our quick start guide here:

All the best,
